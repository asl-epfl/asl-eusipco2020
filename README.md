This code can be used to generate simulations similar to Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the following paper:

Virginia Bordignon, Vincenzo Matta, and Ali H. Sayed,  "Adaptation in online social learning,''  Proc. EUSIPCO, pp. 1-5, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, August 2020. [![DOI:10.23919/Eusipco47968.2020.9287445](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.23919/Eusipco47968.2020.9287445.svg)](https://doi.org/10.23919/Eusipco47968.2020.9287445)

Fig. 1 is generated executing file 'codefig1.py'.

Figs. 2, 3 and 4 are generated executing file 'codefig234.py'.

Please note that the code is not generally perfected for performance, but is rather meant to illustrate certain results from the paper. The code is provided as-is without guarantees.
